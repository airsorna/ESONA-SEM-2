              <Point>What Is Data Visualization?</Point>
              <p>Data visualization has many definitions, but I feel there are only two that are descriptive and encompass the important underlying fact, which is the visual representation of data. The first says, "Data visualization is the practice of translating information into a visual context, such as a map or graph, to make data easier for the human brain to understand and pull insights from. The main goal of data visualization is to make it easier to identify patterns, trends and outliers in large data sets." (Brush, 2020). The second says, "Data visualization is the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format, and a data visualization tool is the software that generates this presentation. Data visualization provides users with intuitive means to interactively explore and analyze data, enabling them to effectively identify interesting patterns, infer correlations and causalities, and supports sense-making activities." (Li, 2020).</p>
              <p>Looking at these definitions, we see that data visualization is a process of standardizing complex or compound data into more consumable chucks of information for easy comprehension and useability for the user. This involves the conversion of information into graphs, maps, charts, and diagrams with the sole purpose to make identifying patterns, trends, and outliers within the image easier by investigating and evaluating large data sets. In summary, "Data visualization provides a quick and effective way to communicate information in a universal manner using visual information." (Brush, 2020). This is mainly because "Data visualization is one of the steps of the data science process, which states that after data has been collected, processed and modeled, it must be visualized for conclusions to be made. Data visualization is also an element of the broader data presentation architecture (DPA) discipline, which aims to identify, locate, manipulate, format and deliver data in the most efficient way possible." (Brush, 2020). It is for this reason that structuring data using graphs, charts, diagrams, maps, and illustrations is ideal for creating cognition, as we consume data better as images than text. Cognition in this context means the "processes in human beings like perception, attention, learning, memory, thought, concept formation, reading, and problem solving." (STU, 2016). The human brain can identify and distinguish differences in line length, shape, orientation, distances, and color (hue) without requiring extensive processing. This is called human perception, it "refers to the way sensory data is organized, interpreted and consciously experienced. Also, perception can be defined as "the process of recognizing (being aware of), organizing (gathering and storing), and interpreting (binding to knowledge) sensory information" (Li, 2020). </p>
              <p>When quantitative data is presented to the user in a graphical form, the process of "meaning-making" or human perception takes place as the brain detects changes and makes comparisons between quantities, locations, sizes, textures, densities, shapes, orientations, colours, and variations in lightness in order to gain insight.</p>
              <p>Data visualization is made up of two major sub-fields: information visualization and scientific visualization. Information visualization is the presentation of abstract data in a visual format. "Information visualization allows users to draw insights from abstract data in an efficient and effective manner." (Interaction Design Foundation, 2020). Scientific visualization is the presentation of scientific-physical data in a visual format. It involves "displaying complex data in visual form [that] provides a clear and intuitive approach to processing big data analytics and enhances understanding, exploration, and decision-making with the use of familiar, visual metaphors." (Heavy.AI, 2022). Both information visualization and scientific visualization transform raw data into a visual format because "When a user reads or looks at a graphical image, the image is interpreted through the human cognitive system for the acquisition of insight or the apprehension of useful information." (Li, 2020) thereby making it easy to understand and interpret. Therefore, data visualization "plays an important role in making data digestible and turning raw information into actionable insights. It draws from the fields of human-computer interaction, visual design, computer science, and cognitive science, among others." (Interaction Design Foundation, 2020). It functions to make data readily usable and understandable to anyone across the world.</p>
              <Point>The Definition of Data and Information</Point>
              <p>Simply put, data is raw and unprocessed information that has still yet to be given meaning. For example, gold is a raw material that is yet to be processed and made into a necklace, so, in this case, gold represents data. Data can be sorted as names, numbers, symbols, and reports, just to name a few. There are two types of data: primary data and secondary data. Primary data is the data collected from units or individual respondents directly with the intention of fulfilling a certain study of information and Secondary data, on the other hand, is data collected from another set of data. I.e., data collected from a survey report is secondary data. Basically, "primary data can be considered as raw data and the secondary data can be considered as information." (Li, 2020). Moreover, "Data and information have a very close relationship as data is usually defined as ‘unprocessed information’ and information considered ‘processed data’" (Li, 2020). Until data has been processed into information for human consumption, it has no value or significance other than just being a raw material like gold.</p>
              <Point>The Forms of Traditional Data Visualization</Point>
              <p>In this section, the author lists the main forms of traditional data visualization, I’ll quickly run down all of them. Note here that each form of data visualization follows the information design structure, which "aims to design the efficient communication of information as its foremost task, which requests the content needs accurate and unbiased in the visual presentation. It attempts to present all the objective data required to enable the users to make some kind of decision" (Li, 2020). to ensure the user understands the information displayed to him.</p>
              <Point>Trees</Point>
              <p>“Trees are considered one of the earliest visual illustrations of human thought systems” (Li, 2020)</p>
              <Point>Maps</Point>
              <p>“A map is considered as a graphical depiction highlighting relationships between elements of space (objects or regions)” (Li, 2020)</p>
              <Point>Scatter Plots</Point>
              <p>“A scatter plot is considered as one of the earliest and most widely used data visualizations, which is based on the Cartesian coordinate system” (Li, 2020)</p>
              <Point>Charts</Point>
              <p>“Charts are the useful forms to represent data in line, bar, or slice forms.” (Li, 2020)</p>
              <Point>Tables</Point>
              <p>“A table is one of the most common forms to display data within many fields. The data table can be an efficient form to comparative data on categorical objects. It usually uses rows and columns to represent data in two dimensions in the meaningful way. The quantitative data are placed in the square sited at the intersection of the row and column (named Table cells).” (Li, 2020)</p>
              <Point>Diagram</Point>
              <p>“A diagram can be used in business-system analysis that consists of rectangles and lines illustrating information flow.” (Li, 2020)</p>
              <Point>Graphs</Point>
              <p>“A graph is similar to a diagram. In fact, the terms graph, diagram and chart are similar and can overlap. Graphics may have many purposes for presenting data. For example, a graph can help people to perceive and recognize the broad features of the data or information.” (Li, 2020)</p>
              <Point>Waveform</Point>
              <p>“Waveform is a common form that is used in visual representation of the form of a signal, which refers to the shape of the time related to various quantities of data.” (Li, 2020)</p>
              <Point>Simulation</Point>
              <p>“Simulation is one of most useful forms of scientific visualization. One of the important advantages of simulation is that it enables viewers to understand and describe natural phenomena such as weather changes or the role of dark energy in the universe” (Li, 2020)</p>
              <Point>Volume</Point>
              <p>“Volume data set are multidimensional arrays of scalar data and vector data, which are typically defined on lattice structures representing values sampled in 3D environment” (Li, 2020)</p>
              <Point>Reference List</Point>

                <Point>Reflection</Point>
                <p>Taking into account that this is a prototype, I have designed this with the mindset that more will be added as time goes on. However, I have implemented some exciting functions and features on this website. Starting with the homepage, the "Welcome" text greets the user with an animation that fades in at the centre of the web page. To see it again, you must refresh the page. This is a nice feature I hope to build on and probably make each letter do its own little animation.</p>
                <p>As for navigation, I’ve implemented a black circular background on the active page to make the user aware of what page they are currently reading. The effectiveness of this compliments the other web page buttons, i.e., when you are trying to move from "Blog" to "Data-Art", there is a visual indicator that shows you have successfully left the "Blog" and you are currently on "Data-Art" with the help of the black circular background.</p>
                <p>I have made the web page buttons responsive when the user hovers over them. The color of the text changes from white to orange and the letters space out. Basically, there is a change in colour and position of the text to communicate to the user that this is clickable by grabbing the user’s attention.</p>
                <p>Finally, color choice is driven by the background. As you can see, my background is blue-ish in colour, so keeping with the theme, I chose colours that aren’t far from that aesthetic. With the orange colors incorporated, i.e., welcome and web page text, the aim with those was to make them stand out and, again, fit the color theme aesthetic I was using. Orange happened to be that color.</p>

             <Point>IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF UI AND UX</Point>
              <p>The premise of today’s writing is to analyze and give a report on my website’s user interface and user experience. My analysis will be guided by Peta Goldberg’s lecture notes and the Jair C. Leite reading so as to give an accurate diagnosis of the structural design of my prototype 1 website.</p>
              <Point>STRUCTURE AND DESIGN</Point>
              <p>To begin the analysis, I will explain the structure and design of the website using the style-guide and screenshots. Figure 1.1 shows the homepage screenshot. Now, considering that this is a prototype, I have designed this with the mindset that more will be added as time goes on. However, I have implemented some exciting functions and features on this website. Starting with the homepage, the "Welcome" text greets the user with an animation that fades in at the centre of the web page. To see it again, you must refresh the page. This is a nice feature I hope to build on and probably make each letter do its own little animation.</p>
              <p>The logic behind the homepage is to introduce the user to your website with minimum but adequate information about what? where? and how? Information is structured and stored as. The web page can be broken down into 3 parts: the top, middle, and bottom. The top has the logo, home, blog, design, data-visualization, and data-art. The middle has content, and the bottom is the footer.</p>
              <p> 
                <img src="Screenshot (12).png" class="image"><class="u-photo">

                Figure 1.2 Blog post section screenshot.
              </p>
              <p>The information is stored in these 3 parts. Navigational information at the top, guides the user to web pages; the middle contains the visual and text information (the web content) of the website. And the bottom contains contact information. This is the structural blueprint design of my website as illustrated in figure 1.2. How this works is that the user focuses more attention on the middle, where all the content information is, and they look up to navigate in and out of web pages, finally looking down to see the developer’s information.</p>
              <p>

                Figure 1.2 Blog post section screenshot.

              </p>
              <p>In terms of navigation, I've used a black circular background on the active page to alert the user to which page they are currently reading. The effectiveness of this complements the effectiveness of the other web page buttons. For example, when attempting to move from "Blog" to "Data-Art," there is a visual indicator that shows you have successfully left the "Blog" and are currently on "Data-Art" with the help of the black circular background.</p>
              <p>I made the web page buttons responsive when the user hovered over them. The text color changes from white to orange, and the letters space out. Essentially, the color and position of the text are changed to communicate to the user that this is clickable by capturing the user's attention.</p>
              <p>Finally, color choice is influenced by the background. As you can see, my backdrop is blue-ish in color, so I picked colors that are close to that style. The orange hues were used to make the welcome and web page content stand out while also fitting the color and aesthetic I am using. Orange happened to be the perfect color to use. The white and black text are driven mainly by clarity and readability. It is important that the reader be able to read the text at the top, middle, and bottom.</p>
              <Point>THE ANALYSIS</Point>
              <p>What constitutes good UI & UX? According to Jair Leite, "User Interface (UI) is a message that communicates to users what they can do with an application and how they can use it." (Leite, 2002). He describes UI using the interaction model, which can be broken into 3 parts:</p>
              <p>"<Cite>The Function Command</Cite> specifies the way users enter information and control the execution of application function. <Cite>Interaction results</Cite> are user to provide feedback to users about function results or error messages. <Cite>The Browsing Control</Cite> is an optional component that is used to allow users to control another user interface objects. Pop-up and pull-down menus and the window minimization and maximization controls are examples of browsing control." (Leite, 2002).</p>
              <p>According to him, UI is made up of three components. First, we have "Interface signs are the widgets, icons, words, menus, dialog boxes, wizards (assistant) and all interface elements that can convey messages. Interface signs convey designer’s message to users and are also a medium to the interaction activity." (Leite, 2002). Second, "the Display Medium is the physical medium where all interface signs are conveyed. The interaction activity happens through it. The display medium is usually the computer screen." (Leite, 2002). And lastly, "The Activation Tool refers to any mechanism that can be used to perform actions using the interface signs in the display medium. Users’ arms and fingers, mouse device, light-pens are examples of the activation tool." (Leite, 2002). I can therefore use this as a checklist for my website for the purpose of critiquing and assessing my UI implementation.</p>
              <p>Figure 1.2 clearly shows interface signs with the implementation of the widgets and text on the header, which conveys a message of interaction to the user. As I stated earlier, I've used a black circular background on the active page to alert the user to which page they are currently reading, and I made the web page buttons responsive when the user hovered over them. The text color changes from white to orange, and the letters space out. The display medium is a PC, and the activation tool would be a mouse.</p>
              <p>Now moving into UX. Peta Goldberg speaks about having information architecture in your design. This is "the way a website/app is structured and how the content is organized. The goal is to help users find information and complete tasks." (Goldberg, 2022). One way to achieve this is with readability and legibility. Both have to do with the typology and arrangement of text or information. On my website, I used Times New Roman as my font and centrally arranged everything. In figure 1.2 you can see that the headings are given a bigger font and are underlined with purple lines. This makes the visual weight of the website light as the user is able to read comfortably and clearly without squinting or straining their eyes.</p>
              <p>By keeping the content central, I am able to guide the user's eyes. This is referred to as "hierarchy" and it "directly relates to how well content can be processed by people using a platform. It refers to the importance of elements within a design."  (Goldberg, 2022). Content is the important component of the website, so having it arranged correctly goes a long way in improving UX. I feel I did fairly well with this. I should work on improving the visual hierarchy on the page because, according to Goldberg, "Visual hierarchy enables visitors to scan information. It helps you communicate a message quickly and effectively." (Goldberg, 2022). In Figure 1.2, the blog post has no visual hierarchy so as to help the user quickly scan the information in passing. The implementation of this would improve UX drastically as the user would be able to find what they are looking for much faster, thus creating "Whitespace – Positive space weighs more than negative space or whitespace" (Goldberg, 2022). Finally, I will implement a drop menu also.</p>

             <article>
              <div class="e-content">
               <Point>Summary</Point>
               <p>In the context of data visualization, the term "interaction" is imprecise and perplexing. We contend that the uncertainty stems from a lack of a consensus definition. To address this issue, we begin by synthesizing a comprehensive perspective of interaction in the visualization community. Our concept is intended to serve as a thinking tool and to stimulate new and daring interface design methods. What exactly is data visualization interaction?</p>
               <p>A compact definition that captures human intent and interaction causality, is technology agnostic, and includes the full spectrum of human senses. By categorizing interactions based on data-level actions and intents in relation to the visualization pipeline, we provide a systematic approach for describing and comparing visualization systems. We hope that our inclusive view of interaction will unify the visualization community around a common goal.</p>
               <p>For visualization, we synthesize the following succinct definition of interaction. The interaction for visualization is the interaction of a person with a data interface. It entails a data-related desire, at least one action by the individual, and a perceived interface reply. We employ the word "person" instead of the typically reported notion of a human "user."</p>
               <p>We investigate how the concept of authorized actions provided by a data interface might be leveraged to increase its flexibility. We first offer a taxonomy of possible actions, which we then utilize to operationalize the data interface's flexibility. Then we show how the idea of flexibility may be used to define and compare data interfaces in practice.</p>
               <p>Interaction is distinct from interaction techniques, interactivity, and the science of interaction. Interaction refers to an action-reaction dialogue between a user and a visualization system, whereas interactivity refers to the feel, properties, and quality of this interaction. Making them actionable requires a precise view of what interaction is. It is the study of methods by which humans create knowledge through interaction, and it involves developing theories and practices to better support interaction.</p>
               <p>Operators such as data kinds, means, cardinality, (temporal) order, and user roles are used in system-centric techniques to characterize interaction (developers, authors, and end users). The human-centric approach broadens the scope of user intent by taking into account interaction aspects other than data, technologies, and tasks. Interactions such as notes (external sources of data and external information) and history that connect to insight acts are introduced in high-level cognitive tasks.</p>
               <p>In the realm of visualization, interaction is defined as a conversation between a human user and a visualization system on a core topic of interest: data. This conversation has little external and internal flexibility, and it frequently restricts user intentionality to data-analysis aims. To solve these restrictions, we turn to the related discipline of HCI, which is where interaction originated.</p>
               <p>The visualization reference model, often known as the visualization pipeline, is one of the most common ideas used to define a visualization system. Interaction occurs through input and output from a computer standpoint, as well as perception and action from a user standpoint. A good interaction enhances the dialogue's directness, simplicity, and "naturalness," while simultaneously offering "a strong sense of comprehension and control." Within given limits, good interaction increases usefulness to the best of the user's skills. It is founded on the rationality paradigm [108] as well as adaption theories like information foraging [93].</p>
               <p>In this idea, interaction is viewed as a phenomenon affected by user expectations, immediate reactions, and recollection. The goal is non-utilitarian: it prioritizes joy and purpose over performance and efficiency.</p>
               <p>The ultimate purpose of visualization is generally stated to be insight, or the development of new information. We believe that broadening the breadth of user intent and adopting intent-agnostic notions will boost interaction for visualization. An intent-driven viewpoint is more human-centered than a data-or task-driven viewpoint.</p>
               <p>We highlighted the need for more adaptable interactions between the tool and the outside world (e.g., environment, social elements, modalities). Following that, we looked at articles that had a concept or a list tag to see how they conceptualized human purpose. A visualization system can accommodate for such purpose and provide the user with freedom.</p>
               <p>Among the different levels of granularity of activities, we concentrate on intermediate-level actions. The visualization pipeline is widely used to depict such data-level interactions. We substitute the system-centric interpretation with a semantic interpretation from the standpoint of a human. Our classification is based, in particular, on the person's permitted activities inside the data interface to realize their objectives.</p>
               <p>The cardinality, human modality, and technical modality of an encounter can all be used to classify it. We regard diversity to be the collection of unique controls provided by the data interface to the user for executing tasks. The amount of unique, allowed activities a person may take on a data interface is referred to as its flexibility. This operationalization of flexibility allows for the description and comparison of data interfaces.</p>
               <p>Increasing the cardinality of permissible interactions does not always increase interaction quality in a data interface. Instead, our interaction characterization highlights many research hurdles. Perceptualization acts highlight the difficulty of allowing individuals to create their own visual models (for example, through authoring and free-form sketching). Processing activities highlight the difficulties in providing complicated data queries and integrating statistical modeling and data exploration into a unified interface. Input actions, on the other hand, are the acts that allow us to refine and incorporate human knowledge into an interface.</p>
               <p>However, with limitations they do not claim that their definition encompasses all viewpoints on interaction. Some essential viewpoints (for example, on interaction directness and user engagement) are missing due to restrictions in both the expert input and our paper selection technique. We regard this concept as a thinking tool that the community may use to investigate various methods of reasoning about interaction in visualization.</p>

               <p>Interaction within the data and information visualization context is a mechanism for modifying what the users see and how they see it. (Ward & Yang, 2003). The research shows this to be so because "interaction occurs at all stages of the visualization process of turning raw data into views on the data." (Dimara & Perin, 2020). Therefore, we can conclude that interaction in data visualization is the standardizing of complex data into easy-to-read visual indicators.</p>

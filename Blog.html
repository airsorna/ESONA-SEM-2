              <h2>What Is Data Visualization?</h2>
              <p>Data visualization has many definitions, but I feel there are only two that are descriptive and encompass the important underlying fact, which is the visual representation of data. The first says, "Data visualization is the practice of translating information into a visual context, such as a map or graph, to make data easier for the human brain to understand and pull insights from. The main goal of data visualization is to make it easier to identify patterns, trends and outliers in large data sets." (Brush, 2020). The second says, "Data visualization is the presentation of data in a pictorial or graphical format, and a data visualization tool is the software that generates this presentation. Data visualization provides users with intuitive means to interactively explore and analyze data, enabling them to effectively identify interesting patterns, infer correlations and causalities, and supports sense-making activities." (Li, 2020).</p>
              <p>Looking at these definitions, we see that data visualization is a process of standardizing complex or compound data into more consumable chucks of information for easy comprehension and useability for the user. This involves the conversion of information into graphs, maps, charts, and diagrams with the sole purpose to make identifying patterns, trends, and outliers within the image easier by investigating and evaluating large data sets. In summary, "Data visualization provides a quick and effective way to communicate information in a universal manner using visual information." (Brush, 2020). This is mainly because "Data visualization is one of the steps of the data science process, which states that after data has been collected, processed and modeled, it must be visualized for conclusions to be made. Data visualization is also an element of the broader data presentation architecture (DPA) discipline, which aims to identify, locate, manipulate, format and deliver data in the most efficient way possible." (Brush, 2020). It is for this reason that structuring data using graphs, charts, diagrams, maps, and illustrations is ideal for creating cognition, as we consume data better as images than text. Cognition in this context means the "processes in human beings like perception, attention, learning, memory, thought, concept formation, reading, and problem solving." (STU, 2016). The human brain can identify and distinguish differences in line length, shape, orientation, distances, and color (hue) without requiring extensive processing. This is called human perception, it "refers to the way sensory data is organized, interpreted and consciously experienced. Also, perception can be defined as "the process of recognizing (being aware of), organizing (gathering and storing), and interpreting (binding to knowledge) sensory information" (Li, 2020). </p>
              <p>When quantitative data is presented to the user in a graphical form, the process of "meaning-making" or human perception takes place as the brain detects changes and makes comparisons between quantities, locations, sizes, textures, densities, shapes, orientations, colours, and variations in lightness in order to gain insight.</p>
              <p>Data visualization is made up of two major sub-fields: information visualization and scientific visualization. Information visualization is the presentation of abstract data in a visual format. "Information visualization allows users to draw insights from abstract data in an efficient and effective manner." (Interaction Design Foundation, 2020). Scientific visualization is the presentation of scientific-physical data in a visual format. It involves "displaying complex data in visual form [that] provides a clear and intuitive approach to processing big data analytics and enhances understanding, exploration, and decision-making with the use of familiar, visual metaphors." (Heavy.AI, 2022). Both information visualization and scientific visualization transform raw data into a visual format because "When a user reads or looks at a graphical image, the image is interpreted through the human cognitive system for the acquisition of insight or the apprehension of useful information." (Li, 2020) thereby making it easy to understand and interpret. Therefore, data visualization "plays an important role in making data digestible and turning raw information into actionable insights. It draws from the fields of human-computer interaction, visual design, computer science, and cognitive science, among others." (Interaction Design Foundation, 2020). It functions to make data readily usable and understandable to anyone across the world.</p>
              <h2>The Definition of Data and Information</h2>
              <p>Simply put, data is raw and unprocessed information that has still yet to be given meaning. For example, gold is a raw material that is yet to be processed and made into a necklace, so, in this case, gold represents data. Data can be sorted as names, numbers, symbols, and reports, just to name a few. There are two types of data: primary data and secondary data. Primary data is the data collected from units or individual respondents directly with the intention of fulfilling a certain study of information and Secondary data, on the other hand, is data collected from another set of data. I.e., data collected from a survey report is secondary data. Basically, "primary data can be considered as raw data and the secondary data can be considered as information." (Li, 2020). Moreover, "Data and information have a very close relationship as data is usually defined as ‘unprocessed information’ and information considered ‘processed data’" (Li, 2020). Until data has been processed into information for human consumption, it has no value or significance other than just being a raw material like gold.</p>
              <h2>The Forms of Traditional Data Visualization</h2>
              <p>In this section, the author lists the main forms of traditional data visualization, I’ll quickly run down all of them. Note here that each form of data visualization follows the information design structure, which "aims to design the efficient communication of information as its foremost task, which requests the content needs accurate and unbiased in the visual presentation. It attempts to present all the objective data required to enable the users to make some kind of decision" (Li, 2020). to ensure the user understands the information displayed to him.</p>
              <h2>Trees</h2>
              <p>“Trees are considered one of the earliest visual illustrations of human thought systems” (Li, 2020)</p>
              <h2>Maps</h2>
              <p>“A map is considered as a graphical depiction highlighting relationships between elements of space (objects or regions)” (Li, 2020)</p>
              <h2>Scatter Plots</h2>
              <p>“A scatter plot is considered as one of the earliest and most widely used data visualizations, which is based on the Cartesian coordinate system” (Li, 2020)</p>
              <h2>Charts</h2>
              <p>“Charts are the useful forms to represent data in line, bar, or slice forms.” (Li, 2020)</p>
              <h2>Tables</h2>
              <p>“A table is one of the most common forms to display data within many fields. The data table can be an efficient form to comparative data on categorical objects. It usually uses rows and columns to represent data in two dimensions in the meaningful way. The quantitative data are placed in the square sited at the intersection of the row and column (named Table cells).” (Li, 2020)</p>
              <h2>Diagram</h2>
              <p>“A diagram can be used in business-system analysis that consists of rectangles and lines illustrating information flow.” (Li, 2020)</p>
              <h2>Graphs</h2>
              <p>“A graph is similar to a diagram. In fact, the terms graph, diagram and chart are similar and can overlap. Graphics may have many purposes for presenting data. For example, a graph can help people to perceive and recognize the broad features of the data or information.” (Li, 2020)</p>
              <h2>Waveform</h2>
              <p>“Waveform is a common form that is used in visual representation of the form of a signal, which refers to the shape of the time related to various quantities of data.” (Li, 2020)</p>
              <h2>Simulation</h2>
              <p>“Simulation is one of most useful forms of scientific visualization. One of the important advantages of simulation is that it enables viewers to understand and describe natural phenomena such as weather changes or the role of dark energy in the universe” (Li, 2020)</p>
              <h2>Volume</h2>
              <p>“Volume data set are multidimensional arrays of scalar data and vector data, which are typically defined on lattice structures representing values sampled in 3D environment” (Li, 2020)</p>

            <article>
              <div class="e-content">
                <h2>Reflection</h2>
                <p>Taking into account that this is a prototype, I have designed this with the mindset that more will be added as time goes on. However, I have implemented some exciting functions and features on this website. Starting with the homepage, the "Welcome" text greets the user with an animation that fades in at the centre of the web page. To see it again, you must refresh the page. This is a nice feature I hope to build on and probably make each letter do its own little animation.</p>
                <p>As for navigation, I’ve implemented a black circular background on the active page to make the user aware of what page they are currently reading. The effectiveness of this compliments the other web page buttons, i.e., when you are trying to move from "Blog" to "Data-Art", there is a visual indicator that shows you have successfully left the "Blog" and you are currently on "Data-Art" with the help of the black circular background.</p>
                <p>I have made the web page buttons responsive when the user hovers over them. The color of the text changes from white to orange and the letters space out. Basically, there is a change in colour and position of the text to communicate to the user that this is clickable by grabbing the user’s attention.</p>
                <p>Finally, color choice is driven by the background. As you can see, my background is blue-ish in colour, so keeping with the theme, I chose colours that aren’t far from that aesthetic. With the orange colors incorporated, i.e., welcome and web page text, the aim with those was to make them stand out and, again, fit the color theme aesthetic I was using. Orange happened to be that color.</p>

             <h2>IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF UI AND UX</h2>
              <p>The premise of today’s writing is to analyze and give a report on my website’s user interface and user experience. My analysis will be guided by Peta Goldberg’s lecture notes and the Jair C. Leite reading so as to give an accurate diagnosis of the structural design of my prototype 1 website.</p>
              <h2>STRUCTURE AND DESIGN</h2>
              <p>To begin the analysis, I will explain the structure and design of the website using the style-guide and screenshots. Figure 1.1 shows the homepage screenshot. Now, considering that this is a prototype, I have designed this with the mindset that more will be added as time goes on. However, I have implemented some exciting functions and features on this website. Starting with the homepage, the "Welcome" text greets the user with an animation that fades in at the centre of the web page. To see it again, you must refresh the page. This is a nice feature I hope to build on and probably make each letter do its own little animation.</p>
              <p>The logic behind the homepage is to introduce the user to your website with minimum but adequate information about what? where? and how? Information is structured and stored as. The web page can be broken down into 3 parts: the top, middle, and bottom. The top has the logo, home, blog, design, data-visualization, and data-art. The middle has content, and the bottom is the footer.</p>
              <p> 
                <img src="Screenshot (12).png" class="image"><class="u-photo">

                Figure 1.2 Blog post section screenshot.
              </p>
              <p>The information is stored in these 3 parts. Navigational information at the top, guides the user to web pages; the middle contains the visual and text information (the web content) of the website. And the bottom contains contact information. This is the structural blueprint design of my website as illustrated in figure 1.2. How this works is that the user focuses more attention on the middle, where all the content information is, and they look up to navigate in and out of web pages, finally looking down to see the developer’s information.</p>
              <p>

                Figure 1.2 Blog post section screenshot.

              </p>
              <p>In terms of navigation, I've used a black circular background on the active page to alert the user to which page they are currently reading. The effectiveness of this complements the effectiveness of the other web page buttons. For example, when attempting to move from "Blog" to "Data-Art," there is a visual indicator that shows you have successfully left the "Blog" and are currently on "Data-Art" with the help of the black circular background.</p>
              <p>I made the web page buttons responsive when the user hovered over them. The text color changes from white to orange, and the letters space out. Essentially, the color and position of the text are changed to communicate to the user that this is clickable by capturing the user's attention.</p>
              <p>Finally, color choice is influenced by the background. As you can see, my backdrop is blue-ish in color, so I picked colors that are close to that style. The orange hues were used to make the welcome and web page content stand out while also fitting the color and aesthetic I am using. Orange happened to be the perfect color to use. The white and black text are driven mainly by clarity and readability. It is important that the reader be able to read the text at the top, middle, and bottom.</p>
              <h2>THE ANALYSIS</h2>
              <p>What constitutes good UI & UX? According to Jair Leite, "User Interface (UI) is a message that communicates to users what they can do with an application and how they can use it." (Leite, 2002). He describes UI using the interaction model, which can be broken into 3 parts:</p>
              <p>"<Cite>The Function Command</Cite> specifies the way users enter information and control the execution of application function. <Cite>Interaction results</Cite> are user to provide feedback to users about function results or error messages. <Cite>The Browsing Control</Cite> is an optional component that is used to allow users to control another user interface objects. Pop-up and pull-down menus and the window minimization and maximization controls are examples of browsing control." (Leite, 2002).</p>
              <p>According to him, UI is made up of three components. First, we have "Interface signs are the widgets, icons, words, menus, dialog boxes, wizards (assistant) and all interface elements that can convey messages. Interface signs convey designer’s message to users and are also a medium to the interaction activity." (Leite, 2002). Second, "the Display Medium is the physical medium where all interface signs are conveyed. The interaction activity happens through it. The display medium is usually the computer screen." (Leite, 2002). And lastly, "The Activation Tool refers to any mechanism that can be used to perform actions using the interface signs in the display medium. Users’ arms and fingers, mouse device, light-pens are examples of the activation tool." (Leite, 2002). I can therefore use this as a checklist for my website for the purpose of critiquing and assessing my UI implementation.</p>
              <p>Figure 1.2 clearly shows interface signs with the implementation of the widgets and text on the header, which conveys a message of interaction to the user. As I stated earlier, I've used a black circular background on the active page to alert the user to which page they are currently reading, and I made the web page buttons responsive when the user hovered over them. The text color changes from white to orange, and the letters space out. The display medium is a PC, and the activation tool would be a mouse.</p>
              <p>Now moving into UX. Peta Goldberg speaks about having information architecture in your design. This is "the way a website/app is structured and how the content is organized. The goal is to help users find information and complete tasks." (Goldberg, 2022). One way to achieve this is with readability and legibility. Both have to do with the typology and arrangement of text or information. On my website, I used Times New Roman as my font and centrally arranged everything. In figure 1.2 you can see that the headings are given a bigger font and are underlined with purple lines. This makes the visual weight of the website light as the user is able to read comfortably and clearly without squinting or straining their eyes.</p>
              <p>By keeping the content central, I am able to guide the user's eyes. This is referred to as "hierarchy" and it "directly relates to how well content can be processed by people using a platform. It refers to the importance of elements within a design."  (Goldberg, 2022). Content is the important component of the website, so having it arranged correctly goes a long way in improving UX. I feel I did fairly well with this. I should work on improving the visual hierarchy on the page because, according to Goldberg, "Visual hierarchy enables visitors to scan information. It helps you communicate a message quickly and effectively." (Goldberg, 2022). In Figure 1.2, the blog post has no visual hierarchy so as to help the user quickly scan the information in passing. The implementation of this would improve UX drastically as the user would be able to find what they are looking for much faster, thus creating "Whitespace – Positive space weighs more than negative space or whitespace" (Goldberg, 2022). Finally, I will implement a drop menu also.</p>

               <h2>Summary</h2>
               <p>In the context of data visualization, the term "interaction" is imprecise and perplexing. We contend that the uncertainty stems from a lack of a consensus definition. To address this issue, we begin by synthesizing a comprehensive perspective of interaction in the visualization community. Our concept is intended to serve as a thinking tool and to stimulate new and daring interface design methods. What exactly is data visualization interaction?</p>
               <p>A compact definition that captures human intent and interaction causality, is technology agnostic, and includes the full spectrum of human senses. By categorizing interactions based on data-level actions and intents in relation to the visualization pipeline, we provide a systematic approach for describing and comparing visualization systems. We hope that our inclusive view of interaction will unify the visualization community around a common goal.</p>
               <p>For visualization, we synthesize the following succinct definition of interaction. The interaction for visualization is the interaction of a person with a data interface. It entails a data-related desire, at least one action by the individual, and a perceived interface reply. We employ the word "person" instead of the typically reported notion of a human "user."</p>
               <p>We investigate how the concept of authorized actions provided by a data interface might be leveraged to increase its flexibility. We first offer a taxonomy of possible actions, which we then utilize to operationalize the data interface's flexibility. Then we show how the idea of flexibility may be used to define and compare data interfaces in practice.</p>
               <p>Interaction is distinct from interaction techniques, interactivity, and the science of interaction. Interaction refers to an action-reaction dialogue between a user and a visualization system, whereas interactivity refers to the feel, properties, and quality of this interaction. Making them actionable requires a precise view of what interaction is. It is the study of methods by which humans create knowledge through interaction, and it involves developing theories and practices to better support interaction.</p>
               <p>Operators such as data kinds, means, cardinality, (temporal) order, and user roles are used in system-centric techniques to characterize interaction (developers, authors, and end users). The human-centric approach broadens the scope of user intent by taking into account interaction aspects other than data, technologies, and tasks. Interactions such as notes (external sources of data and external information) and history that connect to insight acts are introduced in high-level cognitive tasks.</p>
               <p>In the realm of visualization, interaction is defined as a conversation between a human user and a visualization system on a core topic of interest: data. This conversation has little external and internal flexibility, and it frequently restricts user intentionality to data-analysis aims. To solve these restrictions, we turn to the related discipline of HCI, which is where interaction originated.</p>
               <p>The visualization reference model, often known as the visualization pipeline, is one of the most common ideas used to define a visualization system. Interaction occurs through input and output from a computer standpoint, as well as perception and action from a user standpoint. A good interaction enhances the dialogue's directness, simplicity, and "naturalness," while simultaneously offering "a strong sense of comprehension and control." Within given limits, good interaction increases usefulness to the best of the user's skills. It is founded on the rationality paradigm [108] as well as adaption theories like information foraging [93].</p>
               <p>In this idea, interaction is viewed as a phenomenon affected by user expectations, immediate reactions, and recollection. The goal is non-utilitarian: it prioritizes joy and purpose over performance and efficiency.</p>
               <p>The ultimate purpose of visualization is generally stated to be insight, or the development of new information. We believe that broadening the breadth of user intent and adopting intent-agnostic notions will boost interaction for visualization. An intent-driven viewpoint is more human-centered than a data-or task-driven viewpoint.</p>
               <p>We highlighted the need for more adaptable interactions between the tool and the outside world (e.g., environment, social elements, modalities). Following that, we looked at articles that had a concept or a list tag to see how they conceptualized human purpose. A visualization system can accommodate for such purpose and provide the user with freedom.</p>
               <p>Among the different levels of granularity of activities, we concentrate on intermediate-level actions. The visualization pipeline is widely used to depict such data-level interactions. We substitute the system-centric interpretation with a semantic interpretation from the standpoint of a human. Our classification is based, in particular, on the person's permitted activities inside the data interface to realize their objectives.</p>
               <p>The cardinality, human modality, and technical modality of an encounter can all be used to classify it. We regard diversity to be the collection of unique controls provided by the data interface to the user for executing tasks. The amount of unique, allowed activities a person may take on a data interface is referred to as its flexibility. This operationalization of flexibility allows for the description and comparison of data interfaces.</p>
               <p>Increasing the cardinality of permissible interactions does not always increase interaction quality in a data interface. Instead, our interaction characterization highlights many research hurdles. Perceptualization acts highlight the difficulty of allowing individuals to create their own visual models (for example, through authoring and free-form sketching). Processing activities highlight the difficulties in providing complicated data queries and integrating statistical modeling and data exploration into a unified interface. Input actions, on the other hand, are the acts that allow us to refine and incorporate human knowledge into an interface.</p>
               <p>However, with limitations they do not claim that their definition encompasses all viewpoints on interaction. Some essential viewpoints (for example, on interaction directness and user engagement) are missing due to restrictions in both the expert input and our paper selection technique. We regard this concept as a thinking tool that the community may use to investigate various methods of reasoning about interaction in visualization.</p>
               <h2>Reflection</h2>
               <p>Interaction within the data and information visualization context is a mechanism for modifying what the users see and how they see it. (Ward & Yang, 2003). The research shows this to be so because "interaction occurs at all stages of the visualization process of turning raw data into views on the data." (Dimara & Perin, 2020). Therefore, we can conclude that interaction in data visualization is the standardizing of complex data into easy-to-read visual indicators.</p>

                <h2>Critical Reflection - Your Data-Driven Artwork</h2>
                <p>What is Data-Driven Artwork? Data art, or data-driven art, is defined as "an artistic practice that relies on the usage of a dataset to convey emotions to the audience." (Benzi, 2019). It is the representation of information in an artistic way. The name implies what it is: "Data Art uses facts, information or statistics about a phenomenon to drive the artistic representation. It stems from generative art and data visualizations and can be classified in the broad category of new media art." (Benzi, 2020). In regard to what I’m doing, we can be specific and say "data can be defined as a representation of facts, concepts, or instructions in a formalized manner, which should be suitable for communication, interpretation, or processing by human or electronic machine." (tutorialspoint, 2022). In this case, using coding to achieve it.</p>
                <p>What I intend to achieve is make a graph using d3.js because I like it for its simplicity and also because I’m more familiar with it. I will make a graph of money verses time called "The Price Of Data In South Africa Over The Last 6 Years" to compare the price of internet data over the last few years to see whether the price is going down or up. This continues the trend and theme of my website of data and internet usage. I will have two axes; the Y-axis will be price and the X-axis will be time. The plan is to have data points made of diamond shapes similar to the ones made by Mike Bostock in this example: <a href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/hexbin" target="_blank">https://observablehq.com/@d3/hexbin</a></p>
                <p>What I like about this is that it gives the user the variety of adjusting the radius to their desired preference while maintaining the core of the information being represented. It maintains the accuracy of the dataset while engaging interactively with the user. Another layer to this is the artistic side of the graph. The gradient blue-purple colourway with adjusting light and dark patches tells a story about the dataset. Users pay more attention to the darker portions as they are more highlighted and stand out. This conveys a message of importance as the dark patches are the strongest or most prevalent parts of the data set. Key to my own development would mean I keep this design as I find it very interesting and clearly used.</p>
                <p>At the same time, I find a graph like <a href="https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/u-s-population-by-age-and-sex/3" target="_blank">https://observablehq.com/@mbostock/u-s-population-by-age-and-sex/3</a> to be very well designed for its simplicity and clearcut representation of information. It is one I see no problem with doing, but must be given more artistic rejuvenation in order to meet the standards of requirements for the upcoming assignment, on which I aim to get high grades. This would suit the type of data I wish to represent because on one end you have the X-axis, which will be time, and on the other end you have the Y-axis, which is price. Now in-between that in the dataset itself, you will have a percentage increase in price for the internet-data price. This would further add a new layer to the data itself, giving it more clarity and readability for the user.</p>
                <p>What I could possibly do is combine the two and make one graph that has the practicality and clarity of the dataset being communicated mixed in with the aesthetic representation of data in an artistic and creative manner. To begin this, I have set up the dataset for what I want, beginning with the important variable that needs to be well articulated for the graph to make sense to the user. These would be labels, data points, and statistics. I want to focus on getting these things right first before the glamor of aesthetics comes into play. As for the aesthetic-cosmetics, I would most likely replicate the first graph as I see it well designed in contributing to the communication of information. Therefore, I conclude and believe this graph is of the right design and has relevant information. My analysis of it would be positive, seeing that this is something of my own making through self-teaching.</p>

              <h2>Data Visualisation, Art, and Representation</h2>
              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>The use of semiotics in data visualization and data art helps to communicate a message to the user; it is through semiotics that we understand the signs and symbols used in data visualization and art. Semiotics, simply put, is the study of how signs and symbols (visual or verbal) are used to create meaning and thereafter used in communicating messages. How this works is that data visualization takes large sets of data and standardizes it into a visual format for quick and easy interpretation; this process of standardization is semiotic because "data visualization provides a quick and effective way to communicate information in a universal manner using visual information." (Brush, 2020).  And by "universal manner," they mean signs and symbols, as "semiotics is a key tool to ensure that intended meanings (of for instance a piece of communication or a new product) are unambiguously understood by the person on the receiving end. Usually there are good reasons if someone doesn’t understand the real intention of a message, and semiotics can help unravel that confusion, ensuring clarity of meaning." (Sign Salad, 2022). In this essay, I will be discussing the role and relationship of semiotics in creating and communicating meaning in data visualization and art.</p>
              <h2>Representation in Data visualisation and art</h2>
              <p>What is data visualization? It "is the practice of translating information into a visual context, such as a map or graph, to make data easier for the human brain to understand and pull insights from." (Brush, 2020). Data visualization is the representation of data in a visual format. It could be in the form of a graph, map, or chart. However, the process is to convert complex or compound data and simplify it for easy usability. The process relies on the human brain to have an understanding of the signs and symbols used as they help construct meaning. Kidd (2015: 20) notes this and says "semiotics rests on an understanding that the words, language and other signs which we use in our everyday and social contexts help to shape our reality." In this case, it helps shape our understanding of information presented through data visualization</p>
              <p>The aim of data visualization is to collect and store data, then "identify, locate, manipulate, format, and deliver data in the most efficient way possible." (Brush, 2020). These are important steps to consider, as data can be represented in many ways. Identification [figure 1.1] of what kind of graph to use is crucial in the process of constructing meaning because each graph carries its own meaning. Each graph has a specific purpose and is designed to represent a certain type of data to ensure the intended meaning is conveyed without confusion. Readers will read and understand a line graph differently from a bar or chart graph because "things don’t mean: we construct meaning using representational systems—concepts and signs" (Kidd, 2015: 22) and so "signs are grouped together into codes that construct meaning" (Kidd, 2015: 21). Therefore, each graph is suitable for a certain kind of data. For example, line or candlestick graphs are commonly used to represent stocks because they are a simpler and more effective way of representing this kind of data, and bar graphs are commonly used for comparisons. This is because meaning is constructed through the use of these signs and symbols. The spikes and shape of the graph are visual signs that contribute to the overall meaning of the graph, resulting in an understanding of the data or information being shown to the reader. This goes for all the graphs shown in Figure 1.1. Each graph has its own specific purpose and meaning.</p>

              </p>
              <p>The semiotics of color and titles also help in constructing meaning. The use of titles gives context to the graph, which plays a role in helping the user understand the data. Color plays a big role in constructing meaning as it impacts our decision-making process. It can be used effectively to emphasize the main points because "colors provide information on quantities. They make it possible to highlight certain data. They also provide information on the value of data sets (hazard levels, positivity, negativity, etc.). The colors have a symbolism that must be taken into account!" (Lallemand, 2021). When color is used correctly, it can be a strong sign and symbol for constructing meaning because "visual communication can be understood as more ambiguous, suggestive, and open to multiple interpretations than other forms of communication, not least because the codes that are utilized main unspoken, are not pinned down in language, and are non-textual." (Kidd, 2015: 26–27). And since color is a non-textual code, it then becomes an important signifier within the graph for leading readers to a common conclusion and understanding of the data presented.</p>
              <p>Data art, similar to data visualization, uses signs and symbols to construct meaning. What is "data-driven art"? Data art, or data-driven art, is defined as "an artistic practice that relies on the usage of a dataset to convey emotions to the audience." (Benzi, 2019). It "uses facts, information, or statistics about a phenomenon to drive the artistic representation. It stems from generative art and data visualizations and can be classified in the broad category of new media art." (Benzi, 2020). Similar to data visualization, "the artworks must be based on actual data rather than the metaphors or surface appearance of visualization." (Viégas and Wattenberg, 2007: 3). The artwork is driven by the dataset, which then can be used in the creation of meaning. Art is a very powerful tool in communicating a message to the viewer, but, as stated before, visual communication is the most suggestive and open to many interpretations. This is due to socialization and culturalization. For example, in my culture, a black cat may be a sign of bad luck, but to another, it may be a sign of good fortune. This then leaves artists in a very difficult situation, as they can only hope viewers understand the point they are trying to make. Kidd explains how this will play out:</p>
              <h4>“In Saussurean semiotics, it is the coming together of signifier and signified (the form and the idea) which gives us the sign. There is a difference being marked here between the form and the conceptual level of meaning making, and the connection between them is, as we noted, arbitrary. These connections are instead dependent on context, and on social and cultural cues.” (Kidd, 2015: 21).</h4>
              <p>As the artist creates art, he relies on social and cultural cues to convey the message. The artwork will contain signifiers that await interpretation [being signified] by the viewer, which will then begin the process of constructing meaning. What is most impressive about this is the fact that "techno-artworks can reach out to people in a very direct way, by drawing on their imaginative and emotional capacities." (Roeser, 2016: 128). When the viewer is aware of the connotative nature of the artwork, it prompts an emotional response, which is good because it shows the viewer understands what the artwork represents. Being able to capture the viewer's emotions is especially good when addressing serious matters that need attention, as we know that "techno-art can help people to make abstract problems concrete, explore new scenarios, challenge their imaginations, and broaden their narrow personal perspectives through empathy, sympathy and compassion" (Roeser, 2016: 130).This means that artists must take the time to identify correct and appropriate signs and symbols to use in their artwork because they play an important role in constructing a narrative or message in the minds of viewers, which stems in part from an understanding of the nature of visual communication's suggestive and open-ended interpretative nature. With that in mind, art can then be used by artists to convey messages of awareness, justice, peace, and love, etc.</p>
              <h2>Conclusion</h2>
              <p>In conclusion, representations play a big role in data visualization and data-driven art. Without semiotics, communicating any sort of message to the reader would be hard to do. Semiotics play a crucial role in the process of constructing meaning. It is through the use of signs and symbols that we are able to understand and relate to the information being presented to us by the web designers. The reason for this is because of the nature of visual communication, which isn’t tied down in meaning by textual clues that give hints that help readers contextualize the information at hand. Readers rely on visual clues to assist in making meaning. We see that for data visualization, the type of graph, title, and use of color are important signs and symbols to consider before making the graph, as they all contribute to the construction of meaning. And, for data-driven art, selecting the appropriate signifiers is critical because each sign and symbol carries a connotation that will be rendered in the minds of the viewers, and one must be aware that connotations may differ depending on the viewer's cultural and societal background. Therefore, both data visualization and data-driven art, when used correctly, can be powerful tools for communicating important and relevant information to the reader.</p>
